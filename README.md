# Delivery Tracking System Prototype

A delivery tracking application prototype that allows users to schedule, monitor, and manage deliveries with ease and flexibility. This system is designed to enhance delivery transparency, improve user experience, and ensure secure parcel handovers.

## Features

### 🗺️ Multi-Point Delivery Scheduling
- Users can select **multiple drop-off points** for a single delivery.
- Flexible route management for complex delivery scenarios.

### 🧍 Rider Selection
- Choose from **available riders** based on availability and proximity.
- Assign riders manually or through an optimized automated system (if supported).

### 📍 Real-Time Rider Tracking
- **Live GPS tracking** of the delivery rider on the map.
- Visualize the **real-time route** and estimated arrival times.

### 💳 Flexible Payment Options
- Supports **multiple payment methods** (e.g., card, wallet, cash).
- Assign who pays for each delivery: **sender**, **receiver**, or **third-party**.

### 🔐 Secure Drop-Off Verification
- An **OTP-based confirmation** system ensures secure and verified parcel handover.
- Only the **receiver with the correct OTP** can complete the delivery process.
